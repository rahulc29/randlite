# randlite

Randlite is a very simple set of implementations of a few pseudo-random number generation algorithms that I thought were
cool.

Most of these algorithms are not cryptographically secure, though I might implement a few of those as well if I feel
like it.

I'm hoping I'll be able to compile these to WebAssembly as well so I might put an in-browser demo of these algorithms.

This is a learning project - don't take any of this seriously.
